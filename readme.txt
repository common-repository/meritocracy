Meritocracy is a Near protocol-powered gamification plugin for WordPress.

== Increase customer engagement without spending a fortune on marketing efforts. ==

Meritocracy's technology of buying and selling crypto tokens is called BuyNear and CashNear. These features empower users to purchase or sell their tokens on your website with exchange rates that you set.
